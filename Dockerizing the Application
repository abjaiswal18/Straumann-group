1. Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in your project's root directory. This file defines how to build a Docker image for your application. 
2. Build the Docker Image: Run the following command in your project directory to build the Docker image:
docker build -t your-application-image .
3. Run the Docker Container: Once the image is built, we can run your application in a Docker container:
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-application-image
